### Dependencies
|Dependency    |Version |
|--------------|--------|
|Node.js       |8.12.0  |
|npm           |6.4.1   |

### Server-side:

#### Node.js
[Node.js®](https://nodejs.org/en/) is a JavaScript runtime built on [Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine](https://developers.google.com/v8/). Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node.js' package ecosystem, [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.

#### Express
[Express](https://expressjs.com/) is a fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

#### MongoDB
[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) is a document database with the scalability and flexibility that you want with the querying and indexing that you need.

### Client-side:

#### React Native (ft. Redux)
[React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) is a JavaScript framework for writing real, natively rendering mobile applications for iOS and Android.  
[Redux](https://redux.js.org/) is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
